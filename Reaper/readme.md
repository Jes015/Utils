# Reaper config

1. Switch between reaper windows [Link](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=248775)

```
---------------------------------
.confg/REAPER/REAPER.ini
gdk_owned_windows_in_tasklist=1
---------------------------------
There's a swell option at the top of the reaper.ini file, it's called "gdk_owned_windows_in_tasklist". It's not enabled by default, but when set to 1 your window manager gets control of all individual REAPER windows. Which means you can ALT-TAB between them, drag plugins across multiple monitors, show window overview etc. Works great in Gnome!
